    "## Component Architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# `PipelineComponent`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The `PipelineComponent` module is a crucial part of the MiniAutoGen framework, providing a range of pipeline components for managing and automating interactions in a multi-agent chat environment. This module includes components for user response processing, agent selection, agent responses, etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide a selection of pre-built components, accessible [here](../miniautogen/pipeline/components/components.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Modular and Extensible Architecture:**\n",
    "   - MiniAutoGen is designed with a modular structure, allowing different functions to be encapsulated within distinct components.\n",
    "   - This approach facilitates system extension and customization, enabling developers to add or modify components as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pipeline Components:**\n",
    "   - Each component represents an operation or a set of operations that can be performed in a conversation.\n",
    "   - These components are organized in a \"pipeline,\" where the processing of a conversation is conducted sequentially through multiple components.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Development Standards:**\n",
    "   - **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each component is responsible for a specific task, adhering to the principle of single responsibility.\n",
    "   - **Abstraction and Encapsulation:** Components are abstractions that hide the complexity of internal processing, offering a clear interface for interaction with the rest of the system.\n",
    "   - **Decorator Design Pattern:** The use of a pipeline where components can be dynamically added or removed suggests an implementation akin to the Decorator pattern, allowing for the runtime composition of behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **State Management:**\n",
    "   - The `state` is managed and passed between components, allowing for context maintenance and continuity throughout a chat session.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Flexibility and Customization:**\n",
    "   - Developers can create custom components to meet specific requirements, integrating external functionalities or complex business logics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architectural Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA):** Each component can be viewed as a service, with clearly defined inputs, processing, and outputs.\n",
    "- **Pipeline Pattern:** The sequence of processing through distinct components follows the pipeline pattern, common in data processing and workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture and development patterns of MiniAutoGen reflect a modern and modular approach to building conversational systems. The emphasis on modularity, extensibility, and the single responsibility of each component makes the framework adaptable to a variety of use cases, promoting efficient and maintainable implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Base Class\n",
    "\n",
    "### `class PipelineComponent(ABC)`\n",
    "#### Description:\n",
    "An abstract base class that defines the structure and essential behavior of pipeline components within the MiniAutoGen framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Abstract Method:\n",
    "##### `process(self, state)`\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Processes the data and optionally modifies the pipeline state.\n",
    "- **Parameters**:\n",
    "  - `state` (`PipelineState`): An instance of the pipeline state that can be accessed or modified by the component.\n",
    "- **Note**: As an abstract method, `process` must be implemented in all subclasses of `PipelineComponent`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementing Custom Pipeline Components\n",
    "Custom pipeline components can be created by subclassing `PipelineComponent` and implementing the `process` method. These components can perform a variety of tasks, such as generating responses, handling user inputs, or logging information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: `MyComponent`\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyComponent(PipelineComponent):\n",
    "    def process(self, state):\n",
    "        # Custom processing logic\n",
    "        modified_state = state  # Modify the state as needed\n",
    "        return modified_state\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

This module includes components for user response processing, agent selection, agent responses, etc...\\n\\nWe provide a selection of pre-built components, accessible [here](../miniautogen/pipeline/components/components.py).\\n\\n\\n### Architecture\\n\\n1. **Modular and Extensible Architecture:**\\n   - MiniAutoGen is designed with a modular structure, allowing different functions to be encapsulated within distinct components.\\n   - This approach facilitates system extension and customization, enabling developers to add or modify components as needed.\\n\\n2. **Pipeline Components:**\\n   - Each component represents an operation or a set of operations that can be performed in a conversation.\\n   - These components are organized in a &#34;pipeline,&#34; where the processing of a conversation is conducted sequentially through multiple components.\\n\\n3. **Development Standards:**\\n   - **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each component is responsible for a specific task, adhering to the principle of single responsibility.\\n   - **Abstraction and Encapsulation:** Components are abstractions that hide the complexity of internal processing, offering a clear interface for interaction with the rest of the system.\\n   - **Decorator Design Pattern:** The use of a pipeline where components can be dynamically added or removed suggests an implementation akin to the Decorator pattern, allowing for the runtime composition of behaviors.\\n\\n4. **State Management:**\\n   - The `state` is managed and passed between components, allowing for context maintenance and continuity throughout a chat session.\\n\\n6. **Flexibility and Customization:**\\n   - Developers can create custom components to meet specific requirements, integrating external functionalities or complex business logics.\\n\\n### Architectural Patterns\\n\\n- **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA):** Each component can be viewed as a service, with clearly defined inputs, processing, and outputs.\\n- **Pipeline Pattern:** The sequence of processing through distinct components follows the pipeline pattern, common in data processing and workflows.\\n\\n\\nThe architecture and development patterns of MiniAutoGen reflect a modern and modular approach to building conversational systems. The emphasis on modularity, extensibility, and the single responsibility of each component makes the framework adaptable to a variety of use cases, promoting efficient and maintainable implementation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Base Class\\n\\n### `class PipelineComponent(ABC)`\\n#### Description:\\nAn abstract base class that defines the structure and essential behavior of pipeline components within the MiniAutoGen framework.\\n\\n#### Abstract Method:\\n##### `process(self, state)`\\n- **Purpose**: Processes the data and optionally modifies the pipeline state.\\n- **Parameters**:\\n  - `state` (`PipelineState`): An instance of the pipeline state that can be accessed or modified by the component.\\n- **Note**: As an abstract method, `process` must be implemented in all subclasses of `PipelineComponent`.\\n\\n## Implementing Custom Pipeline Components\\nCustom pipeline components can be created by subclassing `PipelineComponent` and implementing the `process` method. These components can perform a variety of tasks, such as generating responses, handling user inputs, or logging information.\\n\\n### Example: `MyComponent`\\n```python\\nclass MyComponent(PipelineComponent):\\n    def process(self, state):\\n        # Custom processing logic\\n        modified_state = state  # Modify the state as needed\\n        return modified_state\\n```\\n\\n**Component Exemple:**\\n```\\nfrom openai import OpenAI\\nimport openai\\nimport os\\nimport logging\\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\\nfrom .pipeline import PipelineComponent\\nimport time\\n\\nclass AgentReplyComponent(PipelineComponent):\\n    def process(self, state):\\n\\n        Processa a resposta do agente atual e adiciona essa resposta ao chat em grupo.\\n\\n        Args:\\n            state (PipelineState): Estado atual do pipeline.\\n\\n        Returns:\\n            PipelineState: Estado atualizado do pipeline.\\n\\n        # Acessa o estado atual para obter informações necessárias\\n        agent = state.get_state().get(&#39;selected_agent&#39;)\\n        group_chat = state.get_state().get(&#39;group_chat&#39;)\\n        if not agent or not group_chat:\\n            raise ValueError(&#34;Agent e GroupChat são necessários para AgentReplyComponent.&#34;)\\n        # Implementação da geração da resposta do agente\\n        try:\\n            reply = agent.generate_reply(state)\\n            print(reply)\\n            group_chat.add_message(sender_id=agent.agent_id, message=reply)\\n        except Exception as e:\\n            print(f&#34;Erro ao processar a resposta do agente: {e}&#34;)\\n\\n        return state\\n```\\n\"}, \\n  \\n    {\"sender_id\": \"ADMIN\", \"message\": \"\\nUsing this example code, create a component that saves chat messages in markdown.\\n```python\\ntable_md = chat.get_messages()[[&#39;sender_id&#39;, &#39;message&#39;]]\\n# Specify the file path where you want to save the Markdown file\\nfile_path = &#39;chat.md&#39;\\n\\n# Open the file for writing and save the records in the &#34;Sender_id\\nMessage&#34; format\\nwith open(file_path, &#39;w&#39;) as file:\\n    for index, row in table_md.iterrows():\\n        sender_id = row[&#39;sender_id&#39;]\\n        message = row[&#39;message&#39;]\\n        \\n        # Add a header with the sender_id in bold\\n        file.write(f&#39;### **Sender_id:** {sender_id}\\n\\n&#39;)\\n        \\n        # Add a creative divider line\\n        file.write(&#39;***\\n\\n&#39;)\\n        \\n        # Add the message content\\n        file.write(message)\\n        file.write(&#39;\\n\\n&#39;)\\n        file.write(&#39;\\n\\n&#39;)\\n        file.write(&#39;\\n\\n&#39;)\\n```\\n\"}, \\n  \\n    {\"sender_id\": \"PROJECT_OWNER\", \"message\": \"As the Project Owner, I have reviewed the provided example code to develop a component that saves chat messages in markdown format.

This module includes components for user response processing, agent selection, agent responses, etc...\\n\\nWe provide a selection of pre-built components, accessible [here](../miniautogen/pipeline/components/components.py).\\n\\n\\n### Architecture\\n\\n1. **Modular and Extensible Architecture:**\\n   - MiniAutoGen is designed with a modular structure, allowing different functions to be encapsulated within distinct components.\\n   - This approach facilitates system extension and customization, enabling developers to add or modify components as needed.\\n\\n2. **Pipeline Components:**\\n   - Each component represents an operation or a set of operations that can be performed in a conversation.\\n   - These components are organized in a &#34;pipeline,&#34; where the processing of a conversation is conducted sequentially through multiple components.\\n\\n3. **Development Standards:**\\n   - **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each component is responsible for a specific task, adhering to the principle of single responsibility.\\n   - **Abstraction and Encapsulation:** Components are abstractions that hide the complexity of internal processing, offering a clear interface for interaction with the rest of the system.\\n   - **Decorator Design Pattern:** The use of a pipeline where components can be dynamically added or removed suggests an implementation akin to the Decorator pattern, allowing for the runtime composition of behaviors.\\n\\n4. **State Management:**\\n   - The `state` is managed and passed between components, allowing for context maintenance and continuity throughout a chat session.\\n\\n6. **Flexibility and Customization:**\\n   - Developers can create custom components to meet specific requirements, integrating external functionalities or complex business logics.\\n\\n### Architectural Patterns\\n\\n- **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA):** Each component can be viewed as a service, with clearly defined inputs, processing, and outputs.\\n- **Pipeline Pattern:** The sequence of processing through distinct components follows the pipeline pattern, common in data processing and workflows.\\n\\n\\nThe architecture and development patterns of MiniAutoGen reflect a modern and modular approach to building conversational systems. The emphasis on modularity, extensibility, and the single responsibility of each component makes the framework adaptable to a variety of use cases, promoting efficient and maintainable implementation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Base Class\\n\\n### `class PipelineComponent(ABC)`\\n#### Description:\\nAn abstract base class that defines the structure and essential behavior of pipeline components within the MiniAutoGen framework.\\n\\n#### Abstract Method:\\n##### `process(self, state)`\\n- **Purpose**: Processes the data and optionally modifies the pipeline state.\\n- **Parameters**:\\n  - `state` (`PipelineState`): An instance of the pipeline state that can be accessed or modified by the component.\\n- **Note**: As an abstract method, `process` must be implemented in all subclasses of `PipelineComponent`.\\n\\n## Implementing Custom Pipeline Components\\nCustom pipeline components can be created by subclassing `PipelineComponent` and implementing the `process` method. These components can perform a variety of tasks, such as generating responses, handling user inputs, or logging information.\\n\\n### Example: `MyComponent`\\n```python\\nclass MyComponent(PipelineComponent):\\n    def process(self, state):\\n        # Custom processing logic\\n        modified_state = state  # Modify the state as needed\\n        return modified_state\\n```\\n\\n**Component Exemple:**\\n```\\nfrom openai import OpenAI\\nimport openai\\nimport os\\nimport logging\\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\\nfrom .pipeline import PipelineComponent\\nimport time\\n\\nclass AgentReplyComponent(PipelineComponent):\\n    def process(self, state):\\n\\n        Processa a resposta do agente atual e adiciona essa resposta ao chat em grupo.\\n\\n        Args:\\n            state (PipelineState): Estado atual do pipeline.\\n\\n        Returns:\\n            PipelineState: Estado atualizado do pipeline.\\n\\n        # Acessa o estado atual para obter informações necessárias\\n        agent = state.get_state().get(&#39;selected_agent&#39;)\\n        group_chat = state.get_state().get(&#39;group_chat&#39;)\\n        if not agent or not group_chat:\\n            raise ValueError(&#34;Agent e GroupChat são necessários para AgentReplyComponent.&#34;)\\n        # Implementação da geração da resposta do agente\\n        try:\\n            reply = agent.generate_reply(state)\\n            print(reply)\\n            group_chat.add_message(sender_id=agent.agent_id, message=reply)\\n        except Exception as e:\\n            print(f&#34;Erro ao processar a resposta do agente: {e}&#34;)\\n\\n        return state\\n```\\n\"}, \\n  \\n    {\"sender_id\": \"ADMIN\", \"message\": \"\\nUsing this example code, create a component that saves chat messages in markdown.\\n```python\\ntable_md = chat.get_messages()[[&#39;sender_id&#39;, &#39;message&#39;]]\\n# Specify the file path where you want to save the Markdown file\\nfile_path = &#39;chat.md&#39;\\n\\n# Open the file for writing and save the records in the &#34;Sender_id\\nMessage&#34; format\\nwith open(file_path, &#39;w&#39;) as file:\\n    for index, row in table_md.iterrows():\\n        sender_id = row[&#39;sender_id&#39;]\\n        message = row[&#39;message&#39;]\\n        \\n        # Add a header with the sender_id in bold\\n        file.write(f&#39;### **Sender_id:** {sender_id}\\n\\n&#39;)\\n        \\n        # Add a creative divider line\\n        file.write(&#39;***\\n\\n&#39;)\\n        \\n        # Add the message content\\n        file.write(message)\\n        file.write(&#39;\\n\\n&#39;)\\n        file.write(&#39;\\n\\n&#39;)\\n        file.write(&#39;\\n\\n&#39;)\\n```\\n\"}, \\n  \\n    {\"sender_id\": \"PROJECT_OWNER\", \"message\": \"As the Project Owner, I have reviewed the provided example code to develop a component that saves chat messages in markdown format.

This module includes components for user response processing, agent selection, agent responses, etc...\\n\\nWe provide a selection of pre-built components, accessible [here](../miniautogen/pipeline/components/components.py).\\n\\n\\n### Architecture\\n\\n1. **Modular and Extensible Architecture:**\\n   - MiniAutoGen is designed with a modular structure, allowing different functions to be encapsulated within distinct components.\\n   - This approach facilitates system extension and customization, enabling developers to add or modify components as needed.\\n\\n2. **Pipeline Components:**\\n   - Each component represents an operation or a set of operations that can be performed in a conversation.\\n   - These components are organized in a &#34;pipeline,&#34; where the processing of a conversation is conducted sequentially through multiple components.\\n\\n3. **Development Standards:**\\n   - **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each component is responsible for a specific task, adhering to the principle of single responsibility.\\n   - **Abstraction and Encapsulation:** Components are abstractions that hide the complexity of internal processing, offering a clear interface for interaction with the rest of the system.\\n   - **Decorator Design Pattern:** The use of a pipeline where components can be dynamically added or removed suggests an implementation akin to the Decorator pattern, allowing for the runtime composition of behaviors.\\n\\n4. **State Management:**\\n   - The `state` is managed and passed between components, allowing for context maintenance and continuity throughout a chat session.\\n\\n6. **Flexibility and Customization:**\\n   - Developers can create custom components to meet specific requirements, integrating external functionalities or complex business logics.\\n\\n### Architectural Patterns\\n\\n- **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA):** Each component can be viewed as a service, with clearly defined inputs, processing, and outputs.\\n- **Pipeline Pattern:** The sequence of processing through distinct components follows the pipeline pattern, common in data processing and workflows.\\n\\n\\nThe architecture and development patterns of MiniAutoGen reflect a modern and modular approach to building conversational systems. The emphasis on modularity, extensibility, and the single responsibility of each component makes the framework adaptable to a variety of use cases, promoting efficient and maintainable implementation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Base Class\\n\\n### `class PipelineComponent(ABC)`\\n#### Description:\\nAn abstract base class that defines the structure and essential behavior of pipeline components within the MiniAutoGen framework.\\n\\n#### Abstract Method:\\n##### `process(self, state)`\\n- **Purpose**: Processes the data and optionally modifies the pipeline state.\\n- **Parameters**:\\n  - `state` (`PipelineState`): An instance of the pipeline state that can be accessed or modified by the component.\\n- **Note**: As an abstract method, `process` must be implemented in all subclasses of `PipelineComponent`.\\n\\n## Implementing Custom Pipeline Components\\nCustom pipeline components can be created by subclassing `PipelineComponent` and implementing the `process` method. These components can perform a variety of tasks, such as generating responses, handling user inputs, or logging information.\\n\\n### Example: `MyComponent`\\n```python\\nclass MyComponent(PipelineComponent):\\n    def process(self, state):\\n        # Custom processing logic\\n        modified_state = state  # Modify the state as needed\\n        return modified_state\\n```\\n\\n**Component Exemple:**\\n```\\nfrom openai import OpenAI\\nimport openai\\nimport os\\nimport logging\\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\\nfrom .pipeline import PipelineComponent\\nimport time\\n\\nclass AgentReplyComponent(PipelineComponent):\\n    def process(self, state):\\n\\n        Processa a resposta do agente atual e adiciona essa resposta ao chat em grupo.\\n\\n        Args:\\n            state (PipelineState): Estado atual do pipeline.\\n\\n        Returns:\\n            PipelineState: Estado atualizado do pipeline.\\n\\n        # Acessa o estado atual para obter informações necessárias\\n        agent = state.get_state().get(&#39;selected_agent&#39;)\\n        group_chat = state.get_state().get(&#39;group_chat&#39;)\\n        if not agent or not group_chat:\\n            raise ValueError(&#34;Agent e GroupChat são necessários para AgentReplyComponent.&#34;)\\n        # Implementação da geração da resposta do agente\\n        try:\\n            reply = agent.generate_reply(state)\\n            print(reply)\\n            group_chat.add_message(sender_id=agent.agent_id, message=reply)\\n        except Exception as e:\\n            print(f&#34;Erro ao processar a resposta do agente: {e}&#34;)\\n\\n        return state\\n```\\n\"}, \\n  \\n    {\"sender_id\": \"ADMIN\", \"message\": \"\\nUsing this example code, create a component that saves chat messages in markdown.\\n```python\\ntable_md = chat.get_messages()[[&#39;sender_id&#39;, &#39;message&#39;]]\\n# Specify the file path where you want to save the Markdown file\\nfile_path = &#39;chat.md&#39;\\n\\n# Open the file for writing and save the records in the &#34;Sender_id\\nMessage&#34; format\\nwith open(file_path, &#39;w&#39;) as file:\\n    for index, row in table_md.iterrows():\\n        sender_id = row[&#39;sender_id&#39;]\\n        message = row[&#39;message&#39;]\\n        \\n        # Add a header with the sender_id in bold\\n        file.write(f&#39;### **Sender_id:** {sender_id}\\n\\n&#39;)\\n        \\n        # Add a creative divider line\\n        file.write(&#39;***\\n\\n&#39;)\\n        \\n        # Add the message content\\n        file.write(message)\\n        file.write(&#39;\\n\\n&#39;)\\n        file.write(&#39;\\n\\n&#39;)\\n        file.write(&#39;\\n\\n&#39;)\\n```\\n\"}, \\n  \\n    {\"sender_id\": \"PROJECT_OWNER\", \"message\": \"As the Project Owner, I have reviewed the provided example code to develop a component that saves chat messages in markdown format.

This module includes components for user response processing, agent selection, agent responses, etc...\\n\\nWe provide a selection of pre-built components, accessible [here](../miniautogen/pipeline/components/components.py).\\n\\n\\n### Architecture\\n\\n1. **Modular and Extensible Architecture:**\\n   - MiniAutoGen is designed with a modular structure, allowing different functions to be encapsulated within distinct components.\\n   - This approach facilitates system extension and customization, enabling developers to add or modify components as needed.\\n\\n2. **Pipeline Components:**\\n   - Each component represents an operation or a set of operations that can be performed in a conversation.\\n   - These components are organized in a &#34;pipeline,&#34; where the processing of a conversation is conducted sequentially through multiple components.\\n\\n3. **Development Standards:**\\n   - **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each component is responsible for a specific task, adhering to the principle of single responsibility.\\n   - **Abstraction and Encapsulation:** Components are abstractions that hide the complexity of internal processing, offering a clear interface for interaction with the rest of the system.\\n   - **Decorator Design Pattern:** The use of a pipeline where components can be dynamically added or removed suggests an implementation akin to the Decorator pattern, allowing for the runtime composition of behaviors.\\n\\n4. **State Management:**\\n   - The `state` is managed and passed between components, allowing for context maintenance and continuity throughout a chat session.\\n\\n6. **Flexibility and Customization:**\\n   - Developers can create custom components to meet specific requirements, integrating external functionalities or complex business logics.\\n\\n### Architectural Patterns\\n\\n- **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA):** Each component can be viewed as a service, with clearly defined inputs, processing, and outputs.\\n- **Pipeline Pattern:** The sequence of processing through distinct components follows the pipeline pattern, common in data processing and workflows.\\n\\n\\nThe architecture and development patterns of MiniAutoGen reflect a modern and modular approach to building conversational systems. The emphasis on modularity, extensibility, and the single responsibility of each component makes the framework adaptable to a variety of use cases, promoting efficient and maintainable implementation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Base Class\\n\\n### `class PipelineComponent(ABC)`\\n#### Description:\\nAn abstract base class that defines the structure and essential behavior of pipeline components within the MiniAutoGen framework.\\n\\n#### Abstract Method:\\n##### `process(self, state)`\\n- **Purpose**: Processes the data and optionally modifies the pipeline state.\\n- **Parameters**:\\n  - `state` (`PipelineState`): An instance of the pipeline state that can be accessed or modified by the component.\\n- **Note**: As an abstract method, `process` must be implemented in all subclasses of `PipelineComponent`.\\n\\n## Implementing Custom Pipeline Components\\nCustom pipeline components can be created by subclassing `PipelineComponent` and implementing the `process` method. These components can perform a variety of tasks, such as generating responses, handling user inputs, or logging information.\\n\\n### Example: `MyComponent`\\n```python\\nclass MyComponent(PipelineComponent):\\n    def process(self, state):\\n        # Custom processing logic\\n        modified_state = state  # Modify the state as needed\\n        return modified_state\\n```\\n\\n**Component Exemple:**\\n```\\nfrom openai import OpenAI\\nimport openai\\nimport os\\nimport logging\\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\\nfrom .pipeline import PipelineComponent\\nimport time\\n\\nclass AgentReplyComponent(PipelineComponent):\\n    def process(self, state):\\n\\n        Processa a resposta do agente atual e adiciona essa resposta ao chat em grupo.\\n\\n        Args:\\n            state (PipelineState): Estado atual do pipeline.\\n\\n        Returns:\\n            PipelineState: Estado atualizado do pipeline.\\n\\n        # Acessa o estado atual para obter informações necessárias\\n        agent = state.get_state().get(&#39;selected_agent&#39;)\\n        group_chat = state.get_state().get(&#39;group_chat&#39;)\\n        if not agent or not group_chat:\\n            raise ValueError(&#34;Agent e GroupChat são necessários para AgentReplyComponent.&#34;)\\n        # Implementação da geração da resposta do agente\\n        try:\\n            reply = agent.generate_reply(state)\\n            print(reply)\\n            group_chat.add_message(sender_id=agent.agent_id, message=reply)\\n        except Exception as e:\\n            print(f&#34;Erro ao processar a resposta do agente: {e}&#34;)\\n\\n        return state\\n```\\n\"}, \\n  \\n    {\"sender_id\": \"ADMIN\", \"message\": \"\\nUsing this example code, create a component that saves chat messages in markdown.\\n```python\\ntable_md = chat.get_messages()[[&#39;sender_id&#39;, &#39;message&#39;]]\\n# Specify the file path where you want to save the Markdown file\\nfile_path = &#39;chat.md&#39;\\n\\n# Open the file for writing and save the records in the &#34;Sender_id\\nMessage&#34; format\\nwith open(file_path, &#39;w&#39;) as file:\\n    for index, row in table_md.iterrows():\\n        sender_id = row[&#39;sender_id&#39;]\\n        message = row[&#39;message&#39;]\\n        \\n        # Add a header with the sender_id in bold\\n        file.write(f&#39;### **Sender_id:** {sender_id}\\n\\n&#39;)\\n        \\n        # Add a creative divider line\\n        file.write(&#39;***\\n\\n&#39;)\\n        \\n        # Add the message content\\n        file.write(message)\\n        file.write(&#39;\\n\\n&#39;)\\n        file.write(&#39;\\n\\n&#39;)\\n        file.write(&#39;\\n\\n&#39;)\\n```\\n\"}, \\n  \\n    {\"sender_id\": \"PROJECT_OWNER\", \"message\": \"As the Project Owner, I have reviewed the provided example code to develop a component that saves chat messages in markdown format.

This module includes components for user response processing, agent selection, agent responses, etc...\\n\\nWe provide a selection of pre-built components, accessible [here](../miniautogen/pipeline/components/components.py).\\n\\n\\n### Architecture\\n\\n1. **Modular and Extensible Architecture:**\\n   - MiniAutoGen is designed with a modular structure, allowing different functions to be encapsulated within distinct components.\\n   - This approach facilitates system extension and customization, enabling developers to add or modify components as needed.\\n\\n2. **Pipeline Components:**\\n   - Each component represents an operation or a set of operations that can be performed in a conversation.\\n   - These components are organized in a &#34;pipeline,&#34; where the processing of a conversation is conducted sequentially through multiple components.\\n\\n3. **Development Standards:**\\n   - **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each component is responsible for a specific task, adhering to the principle of single responsibility.\\n   - **Abstraction and Encapsulation:** Components are abstractions that hide the complexity of internal processing, offering a clear interface for interaction with the rest of the system.\\n   - **Decorator Design Pattern:** The use of a pipeline where components can be dynamically added or removed suggests an implementation akin to the Decorator pattern, allowing for the runtime composition of behaviors.\\n\\n4. **State Management:**\\n   - The `state` is managed and passed between components, allowing for context maintenance and continuity throughout a chat session.\\n\\n6. **Flexibility and Customization:**\\n   - Developers can create custom components to meet specific requirements, integrating external functionalities or complex business logics.\\n\\n### Architectural Patterns\\n\\n- **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA):** Each component can be viewed as a service, with clearly defined inputs, processing, and outputs.\\n- **Pipeline Pattern:** The sequence of processing through distinct components follows the pipeline pattern, common in data processing and workflows.\\n\\n\\nThe architecture and development patterns of MiniAutoGen reflect a modern and modular approach to building conversational systems. The emphasis on modularity, extensibility, and the single responsibility of each component makes the framework adaptable to a variety of use cases, promoting efficient and maintainable implementation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Base Class\\n\\n### `class PipelineComponent(ABC)`\\n#### Description:\\nAn abstract base class that defines the structure and essential behavior of pipeline components within the MiniAutoGen framework.\\n\\n#### Abstract Method:\\n##### `process(self, state)`\\n- **Purpose**: Processes the data and optionally modifies the pipeline state.\\n- **Parameters**:\\n  - `state` (`PipelineState`): An instance of the pipeline state that can be accessed or modified by the component.\\n- **Note**: As an abstract method, `process` must be implemented in all subclasses of `PipelineComponent`.\\n\\n## Implementing Custom Pipeline Components\\nCustom pipeline components can be created by subclassing `PipelineComponent` and implementing the `process` method. These components can perform a variety of tasks, such as generating responses, handling user inputs, or logging information.\\n\\n### Example: `MyComponent`\\n```python\\nclass MyComponent(PipelineComponent):\\n    def process(self, state):\\n        # Custom processing logic\\n        modified_state = state  # Modify the state as needed\\n        return modified_state\\n```\\n\\n**Component Exemple:**\\n```\\nfrom openai import OpenAI\\nimport openai\\nimport os\\nimport logging\\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\\nfrom .pipeline import PipelineComponent\\nimport time\\n\\nclass AgentReplyComponent(PipelineComponent):\\n    def process(self, state):\\n\\n        Processa a resposta do agente atual e adiciona essa resposta ao chat em grupo.\\n\\n        Args:\\n            state (PipelineState): Estado atual do pipeline.\\n\\n        Returns:\\n            PipelineState: Estado atualizado do pipeline.\\n\\n        # Acessa o estado atual para obter informações necessárias\\n        agent = state.get_state().get(&#39;selected_agent&#39;)\\n        group_chat = state.get_state().get(&#39;group_chat&#39;)\\n        if not agent or not group_chat:\\n            raise ValueError(&#34;Agent e GroupChat são necessários para AgentReplyComponent.&#34;)\\n        # Implementação da geração da resposta do agente\\n        try:\\n            reply = agent.generate_reply(state)\\n            print(reply)\\n            group_chat.add_message(sender_id=agent.agent_id, message=reply)\\n        except Exception as e:\\n            print(f&#34;Erro ao processar a resposta do agente: {e}&#34;)\\n\\n        return state\\n```\\n\"}, \\n  \\n    {\"sender_id\": \"ADMIN\", \"message\": \"\\nUsing this example code, create a component that saves chat messages in markdown.\\n```python\\ntable_md = chat.get_messages()[[&#39;sender_id&#39;, &#39;message&#39;]]\\n# Specify the file path where you want to save the Markdown file\\nfile_path = &#39;chat.md&#39;\\n\\n# Open the file for writing and save the records in the &#34;Sender_id\\nMessage&#34; format\\nwith open(file_path, &#39;w&#39;) as file:\\n    for index, row in table_md.iterrows():\\n        sender_id = row[&#39;sender_id&#39;]\\n        message = row[&#39;message&#39;]\\n        \\n        # Add a header with the sender_id in bold\\n        file.write(f&#39;### **Sender_id:** {sender_id}\\n\\n&#39;)\\n        \\n        # Add a creative divider line\\n        file.write(&#39;***\\n\\n&#39;)\\n        \\n        # Add the message content\\n        file.write(message)\\n        file.write(&#39;\\n\\n&#39;)\\n        file.write(&#39;\\n\\n&#39;)\\n        file.write(&#39;\\n\\n&#39;)\\n```\\n\"}, \\n  \\n    {\"sender_id\": \"PROJECT_OWNER\", \"message\": \"As the Project Owner, I have reviewed the provided example code to develop a component that saves chat messages in markdown format.

This module includes components for user response processing, agent selection, agent responses, etc...\\n\\nWe provide a selection of pre-built components, accessible [here](../miniautogen/pipeline/components/components.py).\\n\\n\\n### Architecture\\n\\n1. **Modular and Extensible Architecture:**\\n   - MiniAutoGen is designed with a modular structure, allowing different functions to be encapsulated within distinct components.\\n   - This approach facilitates system extension and customization, enabling developers to add or modify components as needed.\\n\\n2. **Pipeline Components:**\\n   - Each component represents an operation or a set of operations that can be performed in a conversation.\\n   - These components are organized in a &#34;pipeline,&#34; where the processing of a conversation is conducted sequentially through multiple components.\\n\\n3. **Development Standards:**\\n   - **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each component is responsible for a specific task, adhering to the principle of single responsibility.\\n   - **Abstraction and Encapsulation:** Components are abstractions that hide the complexity of internal processing, offering a clear interface for interaction with the rest of the system.\\n   - **Decorator Design Pattern:** The use of a pipeline where components can be dynamically added or removed suggests an implementation akin to the Decorator pattern, allowing for the runtime composition of behaviors.\\n\\n4. **State Management:**\\n   - The `state` is managed and passed between components, allowing for context maintenance and continuity throughout a chat session.\\n\\n6. **Flexibility and Customization:**\\n   - Developers can create custom components to meet specific requirements, integrating external functionalities or complex business logics.\\n\\n### Architectural Patterns\\n\\n- **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA):** Each component can be viewed as a service, with clearly defined inputs, processing, and outputs.\\n- **Pipeline Pattern:** The sequence of processing through distinct components follows the pipeline pattern, common in data processing and workflows.\\n\\n\\nThe architecture and development patterns of MiniAutoGen reflect a modern and modular approach to building conversational systems. The emphasis on modularity, extensibility, and the single responsibility of each component makes the framework adaptable to a variety of use cases, promoting efficient and maintainable implementation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Base Class\\n\\n### `class PipelineComponent(ABC)`\\n#### Description:\\nAn abstract base class that defines the structure and essential behavior of pipeline components within the MiniAutoGen framework.\\n\\n#### Abstract Method:\\n##### `process(self, state)`\\n- **Purpose**: Processes the data and optionally modifies the pipeline state.\\n- **Parameters**:\\n  - `state` (`PipelineState`): An instance of the pipeline state that can be accessed or modified by the component.\\n- **Note**: As an abstract method, `process` must be implemented in all subclasses of `PipelineComponent`.\\n\\n## Implementing Custom Pipeline Components\\nCustom pipeline components can be created by subclassing `PipelineComponent` and implementing the `process` method. These components can perform a variety of tasks, such as generating responses, handling user inputs, or logging information.\\n\\n### Example: `MyComponent`\\n```python\\nclass MyComponent(PipelineComponent):\\n    def process(self, state):\\n        # Custom processing logic\\n        modified_state = state  # Modify the state as needed\\n        return modified_state\\n```\\n\\n**Component Exemple:**\\n```\\nfrom openai import OpenAI\\nimport openai\\nimport os\\nimport logging\\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\\nfrom .pipeline import PipelineComponent\\nimport time\\n\\nclass AgentReplyComponent(PipelineComponent):\\n    def process(self, state):\\n\\n        Processa a resposta do agente atual e adiciona essa resposta ao chat em grupo.\\n\\n        Args:\\n            state (PipelineState): Estado atual do pipeline.\\n\\n        Returns:\\n            PipelineState: Estado atualizado do pipeline.\\n\\n        # Acessa o estado atual para obter informações necessárias\\n        agent = state.get_state().get(&#39;selected_agent&#39;)\\n        group_chat = state.get_state().get(&#39;group_chat&#39;)\\n        if not agent or not group_chat:\\n            raise ValueError(&#34;Agent e GroupChat são necessários para AgentReplyComponent.&#34;)\\n        # Implementação da geração da resposta do agente\\n        try:\\n            reply = agent.generate_reply(state)\\n            print(reply)\\n            group_chat.add_message(sender_id=agent.agent_id, message=reply)\\n        except Exception as e:\\n            print(f&#34;Erro ao processar a resposta do agente: {e}&#34;)\\n\\n        return state\\n```\\n\"}, \\n  \\n    {\"sender_id\": \"ADMIN\", \"message\": \"\\nUsing this example code, create a component that saves chat messages in markdown.\\n```python\\ntable_md = chat.get_messages()[[&#39;sender_id&#39;, &#39;message&#39;]]\\n# Specify the file path where you want to save the Markdown file\\nfile_path = &#39;chat.md&#39;\\n\\n# Open the file for writing and save the records in the &#34;Sender_id\\nMessage&#34; format\\nwith open(file_path, &#39;w&#39;) as file:\\n    for index, row in table_md.iterrows():\\n        sender_id = row[&#39;sender_id&#39;]\\n        message = row[&#39;message&#39;]\\n        \\n        # Add a header with the sender_id in bold\\n        file.write(f&#39;### **Sender_id:** {sender_id}\\n\\n&#39;)\\n        \\n        # Add a creative divider line\\n        file.write(&#39;***\\n\\n&#39;)\\n        \\n        # Add the message content\\n        file.write(message)\\n        file.write(&#39;\\n\\n&#39;)\\n        file.write(&#39;\\n\\n&#39;)\\n        file.write(&#39;\\n\\n&#39;)\\n```\\n\"}, \\n  \\n    {\"sender_id\": \"PROJECT_OWNER\", \"message\": \"As the Project Owner, I have reviewed the provided example code to develop a component that saves chat messages in markdown format.

This module includes components for user response processing, agent selection, agent responses, etc...\\n\\nWe provide a selection of pre-built components, accessible [here](../miniautogen/pipeline/components/components.py).\\n\\n\\n### Architecture\\n\\n1. **Modular and Extensible Architecture:**\\n   - MiniAutoGen is designed with a modular structure, allowing different functions to be encapsulated within distinct components.\\n   - This approach facilitates system extension and customization, enabling developers to add or modify components as needed.\\n\\n2. **Pipeline Components:**\\n   - Each component represents an operation or a set of operations that can be performed in a conversation.\\n   - These components are organized in a &#34;pipeline,&#34; where the processing of a conversation is conducted sequentially through multiple components.\\n\\n3. **Development Standards:**\\n   - **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each component is responsible for a specific task, adhering to the principle of single responsibility.\\n   - **Abstraction and Encapsulation:** Components are abstractions that hide the complexity of internal processing, offering a clear interface for interaction with the rest of the system.\\n   - **Decorator Design Pattern:** The use of a pipeline where components can be dynamically added or removed suggests an implementation akin to the Decorator pattern, allowing for the runtime composition of behaviors.\\n\\n4. **State Management:**\\n   - The `state` is managed and passed between components, allowing for context maintenance and continuity throughout a chat session.\\n\\n6. **Flexibility and Customization:**\\n   - Developers can create custom components to meet specific requirements, integrating external functionalities or complex business logics.\\n\\n### Architectural Patterns\\n\\n- **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA):** Each component can be viewed as a service, with clearly defined inputs, processing, and outputs.\\n- **Pipeline Pattern:** The sequence of processing through distinct components follows the pipeline pattern, common in data processing and workflows.\\n\\n\\nThe architecture and development patterns of MiniAutoGen reflect a modern and modular approach to building conversational systems. The emphasis on modularity, extensibility, and the single responsibility of each component makes the framework adaptable to a variety of use cases, promoting efficient and maintainable implementation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Base Class\\n\\n### `class PipelineComponent(ABC)`\\n#### Description:\\nAn abstract base class that defines the structure and essential behavior of pipeline components within the MiniAutoGen framework.\\n\\n#### Abstract Method:\\n##### `process(self, state)`\\n- **Purpose**: Processes the data and optionally modifies the pipeline state.\\n- **Parameters**:\\n  - `state` (`PipelineState`): An instance of the pipeline state that can be accessed or modified by the component.\\n- **Note**: As an abstract method, `process` must be implemented in all subclasses of `PipelineComponent`.\\n\\n## Implementing Custom Pipeline Components\\nCustom pipeline components can be created by subclassing `PipelineComponent` and implementing the `process` method. These components can perform a variety of tasks, such as generating responses, handling user inputs, or logging information.\\n\\n### Example: `MyComponent`\\n```python\\nclass MyComponent(PipelineComponent):\\n    def process(self, state):\\n        # Custom processing logic\\n        modified_state = state  # Modify the state as needed\\n        return modified_state\\n```\\n\\n**Component Exemple:**\\n```\\nfrom openai import OpenAI\\nimport openai\\nimport os\\nimport logging\\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\\nfrom .pipeline import PipelineComponent\\nimport time\\n\\nclass AgentReplyComponent(PipelineComponent):\\n    def process(self, state):\\n\\n        Processa a resposta do agente atual e adiciona essa resposta ao chat em grupo.\\n\\n        Args:\\n            state (PipelineState): Estado atual do pipeline.\\n\\n        Returns:\\n            PipelineState: Estado atualizado do pipeline.\\n\\n        # Acessa o estado atual para obter informações necessárias\\n        agent = state.get_state().get(&#39;selected_agent&#39;)\\n        group_chat = state.get_state().get(&#39;group_chat&#39;)\\n        if not agent or not group_chat:\\n            raise ValueError(&#34;Agent e GroupChat são necessários para AgentReplyComponent.&#34;)\\n        # Implementação da geração da resposta do agente\\n        try:\\n            reply = agent.generate_reply(state)\\n            print(reply)\\n            group_chat.add_message(sender_id=agent.agent_id, message=reply)\\n        except Exception as e:\\n            print(f&#34;Erro ao processar a resposta do agente: {e}&#34;)\\n\\n        return state\\n```\\n\"}, \\n  \\n    {\"sender_id\": \"ADMIN\", \"message\": \"\\nUsing this example code, create a component that saves chat messages in markdown.\\n```python\\ntable_md = chat.get_messages()[[&#39;sender_id&#39;, &#39;message&#39;]]\\n# Specify the file path where you want to save the Markdown file\\nfile_path = &#39;chat.md&#39;\\n\\n# Open the file for writing and save the records in the &#34;Sender_id\\nMessage&#34; format\\nwith open(file_path, &#39;w&#39;) as file:\\n    for index, row in table_md.iterrows():\\n        sender_id = row[&#39;sender_id&#39;]\\n        message = row[&#39;message&#39;]\\n        \\n        # Add a header with the sender_id in bold\\n        file.write(f&#39;### **Sender_id:** {sender_id}\\n\\n&#39;)\\n        \\n        # Add a creative divider line\\n        file.write(&#39;***\\n\\n&#39;)\\n        \\n        # Add the message content\\n        file.write(message)\\n        file.write(&#39;\\n\\n&#39;)\\n        file.write(&#39;\\n\\n&#39;)\\n        file.write(&#39;\\n\\n&#39;)\\n```\\n\"}, \\n  \\n    {\"sender_id\": \"PROJECT_OWNER\", \"message\": \"As the Project Owner, I have reviewed the provided example code to develop a component that saves chat messages in markdown format.

If any issues emerge during testing or integration, we may need to revisit the code and make necessary adjustments.\\n\\nAt this stage, based on the code review, I affirm that DEV_AUTOGEN&#39;s output is in alignment with the established requirements.\"}, \\n  \\n    {\"sender_id\": \"DEV_AUTOGEN\", \"message\": \"```python\\n# filename: markdown_save_component.py\\n\\nimport os\\nimport logging\\nfrom .pipeline import PipelineComponent, PipelineState\\n\\nclass MarkdownSaveComponent(PipelineComponent):\\n    def __init__(self, file_path=&#39;chat.md&#39;):\\n        self.file_path = file_path\\n\\n    def process(self, state: PipelineState):\\n        &#34;&#34;&#34;\\n        Saves the current chat messages in markdown format to the specified file path.\\n\\n        Args:\\n            state (PipelineState): The current pipeline state containing chat messages.\\n\\n        Returns:\\n            PipelineState: The updated pipeline state after saving messages to a file.\\n        &#34;&#34;&#34;\\n        try:\\n            # Fetch the group chat messages from the state\\n            group_chat = state.get_state().get(&#39;group_chat&#39;)\\n            if not group_chat:\\n                raise ValueError(&#34;GroupChat is required for MarkdownSaveComponent.&#34;)\\n            \\n            # Get the sender_id and message from the group chat\\n            messages = group_chat.get_messages()\\n\\n            # Write to the markdown file\\n            with open(self.file_path, &#39;w&#39;) as md_file:\\n                for message in messages:\\n                    sender_id = message[&#39;sender_id&#39;]\\n                    content = message[&#39;message&#39;]\\n                    \\n                    # Formatting the markdown text with header and message\\n                    md_file.write(f&#39;### **Sender_id:** {sender_id}\\\\n\\\\n&#39;)\\n                    md_file.write(&#39;---\\\\n\\\\n&#39;)  # Creative divider line\\n                    md_file.write(f&#39;{content}\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n&#39;)\\n            \\n            logging.info(f&#34;Chat messages saved to {self.file_path} in markdown format.&#34;)\\n        except Exception as e:\\n            logging.error(f&#34;Error saving chat messages to markdown: {e}&#34;)\\n            raise\\n        \\n        return state\\n\\n# Example of how to use the MarkdownSaveComponent\\nif __name__ == &#34;__main__&#34;:\\n    # Assuming &#39;state&#39; is the current conversation state at this point in the pipeline\\n    try:\\n        save_to_md = MarkdownSaveComponent()  # Default path can be overridden\\n        state = save_to_md.process(state)\\n    except Exception as e:\\n        logging.exception(&#34;An error occurred while saving messages to markdown.&#34;)\\n```\\n\\n**Documentation:**\\n\\nThe `MarkdownSaveComponent` is a pipeline component for the MiniAutoGen framework responsible for saving chat messages in a markdown file.

This module includes components for user response processing, agent selection, agent responses, etc...\\n\\nWe provide a selection of pre-built components, accessible [here](../miniautogen/pipeline/components/components.py).\\n\\n\\n### Architecture\\n\\n1. **Modular and Extensible Architecture:**\\n   - MiniAutoGen is designed with a modular structure, allowing different functions to be encapsulated within distinct components.\\n   - This approach facilitates system extension and customization, enabling developers to add or modify components as needed.\\n\\n2. **Pipeline Components:**\\n   - Each component represents an operation or a set of operations that can be performed in a conversation.\\n   - These components are organized in a &#34;pipeline,&#34; where the processing of a conversation is conducted sequentially through multiple components.\\n\\n3. **Development Standards:**\\n   - **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each component is responsible for a specific task, adhering to the principle of single responsibility.\\n   - **Abstraction and Encapsulation:** Components are abstractions that hide the complexity of internal processing, offering a clear interface for interaction with the rest of the system.\\n   - **Decorator Design Pattern:** The use of a pipeline where components can be dynamically added or removed suggests an implementation akin to the Decorator pattern, allowing for the runtime composition of behaviors.\\n\\n4. **State Management:**\\n   - The `state` is managed and passed between components, allowing for context maintenance and continuity throughout a chat session.\\n\\n6. **Flexibility and Customization:**\\n   - Developers can create custom components to meet specific requirements, integrating external functionalities or complex business logics.\\n\\n### Architectural Patterns\\n\\n- **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA):** Each component can be viewed as a service, with clearly defined inputs, processing, and outputs.\\n- **Pipeline Pattern:** The sequence of processing through distinct components follows the pipeline pattern, common in data processing and workflows.\\n\\n\\nThe architecture and development patterns of MiniAutoGen reflect a modern and modular approach to building conversational systems. The emphasis on modularity, extensibility, and the single responsibility of each component makes the framework adaptable to a variety of use cases, promoting efficient and maintainable implementation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Base Class\\n\\n### `class PipelineComponent(ABC)`\\n#### Description:\\nAn abstract base class that defines the structure and essential behavior of pipeline components within the MiniAutoGen framework.\\n\\n#### Abstract Method:\\n##### `process(self, state)`\\n- **Purpose**: Processes the data and optionally modifies the pipeline state.\\n- **Parameters**:\\n  - `state` (`PipelineState`): An instance of the pipeline state that can be accessed or modified by the component.\\n- **Note**: As an abstract method, `process` must be implemented in all subclasses of `PipelineComponent`.\\n\\n## Implementing Custom Pipeline Components\\nCustom pipeline components can be created by subclassing `PipelineComponent` and implementing the `process` method. These components can perform a variety of tasks, such as generating responses, handling user inputs, or logging information.\\n\\n### Example: `MyComponent`\\n```python\\nclass MyComponent(PipelineComponent):\\n    def process(self, state):\\n        # Custom processing logic\\n        modified_state = state  # Modify the state as needed\\n        return modified_state\\n```\\n\\n**Component Exemple:**\\n```\\nfrom openai import OpenAI\\nimport openai\\nimport os\\nimport logging\\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\\nfrom .pipeline import PipelineComponent\\nimport time\\n\\nclass AgentReplyComponent(PipelineComponent):\\n    def process(self, state):\\n\\n        Processa a resposta do agente atual e adiciona essa resposta ao chat em grupo.\\n\\n        Args:\\n            state (PipelineState): Estado atual do pipeline.\\n\\n        Returns:\\n            PipelineState: Estado atualizado do pipeline.\\n\\n        # Acessa o estado atual para obter informações necessárias\\n        agent = state.get_state().get(&#39;selected_agent&#39;)\\n        group_chat = state.get_state().get(&#39;group_chat&#39;)\\n        if not agent or not group_chat:\\n            raise ValueError(&#34;Agent e GroupChat são necessários para AgentReplyComponent.&#34;)\\n        # Implementação da geração da resposta do agente\\n        try:\\n            reply = agent.generate_reply(state)\\n            print(reply)\\n            group_chat.add_message(sender_id=agent.agent_id, message=reply)\\n        except Exception as e:\\n            print(f&#34;Erro ao processar a resposta do agente: {e}&#34;)\\n\\n        return state\\n```\\n\"}, \\n  \\n    {\"sender_id\": \"ADMIN\", \"message\": \"\\nUsing this example code, create a component that saves chat messages in markdown.\\n```python\\ntable_md = chat.get_messages()[[&#39;sender_id&#39;, &#39;message&#39;]]\\n# Specify the file path where you want to save the Markdown file\\nfile_path = &#39;chat.md&#39;\\n\\n# Open the file for writing and save the records in the &#34;Sender_id\\nMessage&#34; format\\nwith open(file_path, &#39;w&#39;) as file:\\n    for index, row in table_md.iterrows():\\n        sender_id = row[&#39;sender_id&#39;]\\n        message = row[&#39;message&#39;]\\n        \\n        # Add a header with the sender_id in bold\\n        file.write(f&#39;### **Sender_id:** {sender_id}\\n\\n&#39;)\\n        \\n        # Add a creative divider line\\n        file.write(&#39;***\\n\\n&#39;)\\n        \\n        # Add the message content\\n        file.write(message)\\n        file.write(&#39;\\n\\n&#39;)\\n        file.write(&#39;\\n\\n&#39;)\\n        file.write(&#39;\\n\\n&#39;)\\n```\\n\"}, \\n  \\n    {\"sender_id\": \"PROJECT_OWNER\", \"message\": \"As the Project Owner, I have reviewed the provided example code to develop a component that saves chat messages in markdown format.
