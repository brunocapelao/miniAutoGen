![MiniAutoGen Logo](miniautogen.png)

## About MiniAutoGen

MiniAutoGen is an innovative open-source library designed to empower next-generation applications in Large Language Models (LLMs) through [multi-agent conversations](docs/eng/multi_agent_chats.md). This framework stands out for its lightweight and flexible structure, making it ideal for developers and researchers looking to explore and push the boundaries of conversational AI.

Inspired by [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen), MiniAutoGen provides a unified conversation interface (`chat`), a [coordination mechanism](docs/eng/coordination.md) (`chatadmin`), agent customization (`agent`), and an action pipeline (`pipeline`), all designed to facilitate the creation, experimentation, and implementation of multi-agent systems.

## Why MiniAutoGen?

### Multi-Agent Conversations
Empower conversations involving multiple intelligent agents, each with distinct abilities, raising the complexity and sophistication of interactions.

### Agent Customization
Tailor agents to meet specific requirements by adapting behavior, reactions, and response patterns as needed.

### Flexibility and Modularity
With MiniAutoGen, you have the freedom to shape dynamic conversations, enabling agent dialogue initiatives, automatic reactions, and human interventions when necessary.

### Effective Agent Coordination
Utilize our framework for agents to collaborate efficiently, working towards common goals in a shared environment.

## Key Components

### Agent
The core of each conversation, representing an individual agent with specific abilities and behaviors, essential for dynamic and autonomous interactions.

### Chat
Manages group chat sessions, ensuring effective maintenance of conversation state and context, essential for continuity and coherence of interactions.

### ChatAdmin
A key element for coordinating group chat, synchronizing actions, and managing conversation dynamics to ensure efficient collaboration.

### Pipeline
Automates and organizes agent operations, promoting scalability and easy system maintenance.
